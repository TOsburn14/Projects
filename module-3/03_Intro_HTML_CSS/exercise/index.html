                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Geralt, is a Witcher from the School of the Wolf. Although it is unknown how he ended up at the
                    location
                    of the school in Kaer Morhen as a young child,
                    Geralt was subjected to the mutations forced upon children which created the breed known as
                    witchers.
                    Many children do not survive this change to their body and often die painful and long-lasting
                    deaths.
                    But Geralt, showed extraordinary resistances to the mutations and was immediately but under
                    additional
                    mutations that were very rare in the Witcher breed.
                    Due to these mutations, Geralt was stronger, faster and had all around better reflexes than any
                    other
                    witcher before. But the consequences were that Geralt
                    retained his emotions while everyone else was stripped of them and his hair turned Ash White. Hence
                    his
                    nickname 'The White Wolf'.

                <h2>Geralt's most notable Feats</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        He is known consistently as the best swordsman in the North. His skills with a blade are
                        unmatched,
                        and his ability to use the Witcher Signs make him the most lethal combination
                        that the world has seen.
                    </p>

                        While Witcher's often have the stereotype of being mindless killers who's only sharpness comes
                        from
                        their sword,
                        Geralt is known as a tactical master and can create a battle plan that rivals the best Kings in
                        the
                        land. He was even
                        capable of outsmarting a demon known as Gaunter O'Dimm, Master of Riddles. It is unknown if
                        Gaunter
                        is a standard demon, or
                        the Devil himself.

                        Geralt's most notable feat is the empathy he has for the monsters' he hunts. While most witchers
                        will killed monsters
                        without a thought and collect their reward and move on due to the mutations removing their
                        emotions,
                        Geralt uses the emotions he maintained
                        to help save the monster if possible. He understands that most monsters are mindless creatures
                        and
                        are often seen as evil creatures because they are different from humans.
                        Geralt will judge the monster by its actions, before making a decision on how to handle the
                        monster.
                        This will often result in Geralt helping the monster find a safe place to live,
                        or break them of whatever curse they've been put under so that it can resume its life in peace.
                        Because, Geralt knows that monsters are thoughtful creatures as well who mostly want to ensure
                        their
                        own
                        safety and are often persecuted by the true monsters of the world, Humans. Geralt does not
                        believe
                        that every issue should be solved by the edge of a blade.

                <blockquote>
                    People like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When
                    they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives,
                    starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing
                    unicorn
                    with arrows, they like to think that the Bane
                    entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find
                    it
                    easier to live.

                        If I’m to choose between one evil and another, I’d rather not choose at all
