            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                Geralt, is a Witcher from the School of the Wolf. Although it is unknown how he ended up at the location of the school in Kaer Morhen as a young child,
                Geralt was subjected to the mutations forced upon children which created the breed known as witchers. 
                Many children do not survive this change to their body and often die painful and long-lasting deaths. 
                But Geralt, showed extraordinary resistances to the mutations and was immediately but under additional mutations that were very rare in the Witcher breed. 
                Due to these mutations, Geralt was stronger, faster and had all around better reflexes than any other witcher before. But the consequences were that Geralt
                retained his emotions while everyone else was stripped of them and his hair turned Ash White. Hence his nickname 'The White Wolf'.
