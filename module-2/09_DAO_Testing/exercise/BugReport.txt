Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project
Expected output:
timesheet 1 should return when the corresponding projectId is called.
Actual output:
returns the result based on employee_id, not project_id
How did you fix this bug?
Replaced within the code "WHERE employee_id = ?" with "WHERE project_id = ?"

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
Test should return 2 timesheets for employee_id 1
Actual output:
Test only returns a single timesheet for the employee
How did you fix this bug?
The code used an IF statement instead of a WHILE loop that would require the loop to restart and run again until the cursor doesn't
have a row.

added within the WHERE statement "AND billable = true"
